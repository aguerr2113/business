business template
 
 This a business template website. 
 its all on one index.html
 the css handles all of the styling
 The code also includes JavaScript functions to add animations and interactivity to the website. 
 The onload function adds a class to the body element after a 4-second delay, which triggers a CSS animation. 
 The hamburger-menu click function toggles a class on the container element to change the appearance of the navigation menu. 
 The scroll-btn click function changes the scroll behavior to smooth for one second before resetting to the default behavior.
 This Python code sets up a Flask web application that provides an index page and a contact form. The web application is configured to use Gmail as its SMTP server to send email messages.
 When a user submits the contact form, the Flask app sends an email to the email address specified in the mail_username variable, which is imported from the config.py module. 
 The email includes the sender's name, email address, and message content. If the email is sent successfully, the user is redirected back to the index page and a success message is displayed.
